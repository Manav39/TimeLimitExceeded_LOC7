üöë Smart Ambulance Booking System for Emergency Healthcare in India
üìñ Overview
In India, accessing timely and reliable ambulance services is a critical challenge, especially during emergencies. Our Smart Ambulance Booking System addresses this problem by providing a fast, efficient, and user-friendly platform to book ambulances, track them in real time, and find the nearest hospitals. By leveraging technology, we aim to bridge the gap between patients and emergency healthcare services, saving precious lives.
